                    <p>I’m Michelle. I was born in San Francisco and raised in the Bay Area. I have a film degree and a strong interest in drama, storytelling, and watching TV and movies. I’ve worked for various literary agencies and film financing companies and basically read thousands of scripts by every kind of writer. I can tell you many, many things that make a bad one, but if someone says they can tell you exactly what makes a good or great one, they're lying.</p></p>

                    <p>I’ve also worked in small business and dabbled in fitness. I always want to learn something new, the more useful the better at this point. Partly because I would like to expand my dinner conversation beyond foreign films and a catalog of X Files episodes, but career opportunities never hurt.  I never got over that D+ in high school physics, so I’m out to redeem myself many times over.</p>
                    <p>I have a Belgian Malinois, who is supposed to be a working dog, but she is woefully unemployed. I also have a twin, but really sucked at the imposter thing so I’ve missed out on the real world benefits of that. My goals include one day being able to do a backflip and having enough professional freedom to work beyond the Bay Area and LA where I have always been</p>
