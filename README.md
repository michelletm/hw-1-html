Hw 1 Portfolio

I was not able to get the box with the picture and bio to line up in proper columns within the rows, namely the second row that should have the picture and a paragraph side by side. Flexbox was a challenge, especially since I had to scrap my original attempt at the assignment which was using Bootstrap. The BS implements don't seem to work in a fully comparable way without the BS stylesheet. 

Also, the "contact" link on the Portfolio page is no lining up the way it is on the others, but I can not locate the broken code in html, css, or inspecting it (although I'm sure it's there).

Lastly, overlaying the caption on the pictures was troublesome, no code I tried would put it directly on the 200x200 picture, instead, it would float randomly in the box, sometimes outside of it.

If I had more time for the assignment, I'd restart the "About" page box with a grid, figure out the fix on the "Portfolio" contact, and figure out the overlay captions. Also, I'd find a way to combine the css stylesheets, since they share a lot in common, and having to make sure those things are the exactly the same across all three style sheets is a challenge, and perhaps part of the reason some of my code is broken.
